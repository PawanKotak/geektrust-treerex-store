# Geektrust Code Challenge

[Geektrust Code Challenge Link](https://www.geektrust.com/coding/detailed/teerex-store)

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I have used [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) also in this project. And React Context API is used for state management

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
